Gateway Server Configuration
==============

in this repository I will save and share all the meaningful configuration files of my little internal server Keid (named after a white dwarf star.. it is a white old netbook..)

 * interfaces: /etc/network/interfaces
 * nat: iptables configuration (in /etc/network/if-up.d)
